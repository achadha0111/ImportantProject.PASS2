# ImportantProject.PASS2
This is an important project

In the repo's initial state the following will occur:
### Merge Conflict:
There might be some conflicts when merging "MergeConflictBranch" and "Master" on Main.java

### Fast Forward:
There might be a fast forward merge on branch "FastforwardMerge" since there are no changes on "Master" after we branched out

### Accidental commit on Master:
Oops this README.md should be committed in a different branch but instead I comit on master, what should I do?
